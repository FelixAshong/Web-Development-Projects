            <h3>1. Brushing twice a day</h3>
            <p>Dental hygiene is very important. Teach your kids how to brush and make your kids realize the importance
                of brushing the
                teeth twice a day right from their childhood. Kids tend to eat a lot, and hence they should have their
                teeth clean to
                prevent cavities. Also, teach them not to eat food after brushing their teeth at night.</p>

            <h3>2. Bathing every day</h3>
            <p>Teach them the hygienic importance of bathing and being neat and clean all the time. You can encourage
                this habit by
                using attractive bathroom tubs, soaps, shampoos and handy toys. Also, bathing twice a day should be
                instilled in the
                kids since their childhood to avoid entry of germs into their body.</p>

            <h3>3. Eat breakfast</h3>
            <p>Get your kid into a routine of breakfast-lunch-dinner to help them avoid unnecessary snacks right from
                the beginning.
                Teach your kids that breakfast is food for the “brain” and helps keep them to stay strong and prevent
                chronic diseases.
                Try making nutritious breakfasts by incorporating varieties of fruits and vegetables that helps your kid
                stay energetic
                and active for the whole day.</p>

            <h3>4. Hand wash
            </h3>
            <p>Hand wash undoubtedly tops the list when it comes to getting your kid adopt healthy habits. Therefore,
                make sure you
                explain the importance of washing hands. Teach your kids to wash hands after using the washroom, before
                eating food,
                after they come home from playing outdoors, to prevent infections. Do teach them to wash their hands
                with soap or liquid
                hand wash for at least 20 seconds.</p>

            <h3>5. Drink water, not soda</h3>
            <p>Keep the message simple by saying that water is healthy while soft drinks are not. Teach them that soft
                drinks contain
                too much sugar which is bad for them. Even if the kids don’t understand why sugar is not good for
                health, you can help
                them understand the important aspects of health. Sugar contained in soft drinks add no nutrients instead
                it adds up the
                unnecessary calories which may lead to several health problems. So make sure you teach this healthy
                habit to your kid.</p>
